Introduction

The privacy of users is a priority. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data collected, how it is used, and the measures taken to protect it.

1. Information Collected

    Location Data (Optional): Access to the device's fine and coarse location is requested to provide location-based features. These permissions are optional and can be granted or denied by the user. Denying                                    these permissions will not affect the ability to use the app, though some features may be limited.

    Installed Apps Data: The list of installed applications is accessed solely to display them within the app for the purpose of app-locking. This data is not shared with third parties and is used exclusively                              within the app.

2. Use of Information

    Location Data: If location permissions are granted, the device's location is used to offer location-based features. If these permissions are denied, no location data is collected or used.
    Installed Apps Data: The list of installed applications is used to display them within the app for the purpose of app-locking. This data is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted to any servers.

3. Data Storage and Security

    All data is stored locally on the device. Industry-standard security measures are implemented to protect the data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

4. Sharing of Information

    Personal information is not shared, sold, or rented to third parties. The data collected is used solely for the functionality of the app and is not shared externally.

5. User Choices

    Location Permissions: Location permissions can be managed through the device's settings. Denying location permissions will not affect the ability to use the app, though some features may be limited.
    Installed Apps Data: The list of installed applications can be managed by adjusting the settings within the app. The list of installed applications is not shared with any external parties.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. Users are encouraged to review this Privacy        Policy periodically to stay informed about how their information is protected.
